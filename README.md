I was annoyed with his selfish response; he wanted me to “ask someone else as he and his family were using so he didn’t want me to watch my shows that could cause the Netflix algorithm to give him weird recommendations and his family would think it was him who watched it instead”. I replied:")

Every time you press play and spend some time watching a TV show or a movie, Netflix is collecting data that informs the algorithm and refreshes it. The more you watch the more up to date the algorithm is and so if I watched anything on his account, the system would refresh and recommend him shows that are not his taste and this can be annoying.")

The SQL injection was easy to perform as all I had to do was go to the site which shows how much we are getting paid for each tasks we have done and how long we have worked for; I then wrote code instead of my username to trick the program to execute my username as a code, which got me admin access to change the values in the database. However, I didn’t expect that there was a camera in the finance office which caught me as I was messing with the computer and was fired then and there. I expected :")
